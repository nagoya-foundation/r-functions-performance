## How it works

We are using "Airplane Crashes and Fatalities Since 1908" public dataset provided by [Open Data by Socrata](https://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Airplane-Crashes-and-Fatalities-Since-1908/q2te-8cvq) with 5268 observations and 13 columns to test some functions.

We run the selected function 1000 times over one column using [microbenchmark R package](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/microbenchmark/) and use `summary()` to analyse the difference in milliseconds between the functions.
