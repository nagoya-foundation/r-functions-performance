# r-functions-performance

This repo was created with the purpose of studying performance of different functions that can be used to obtain the same result.

## How it Works

We are using "Melbourne Housing Market" public dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market) with 60.7k observations and 13 columns to test some functions.

We run the selected function 1000 times over one column using [microbenchmark R package](https://github.com/joshuaulrich/microbenchmark/) and use `summary()` to analyse the difference in milliseconds between the functions.

## Performance Result
